# Understanding Moderate Poverty

Moderate poverty is defined as living on less than $3.20 per day, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). This threshold, established by the World Bank, represents the minimum income level needed to meet basic needs such as food, shelter, and essential services in many developing countries. While it is less severe than extreme poverty (measured at $1.90 per day), moderate poverty still reflects significant deprivation and vulnerability.

Millions of people around the world live in moderate poverty, often struggling to access stable employment, quality healthcare, and education. These conditions not only affect individual well-being but also hinder economic development and social mobility at a national level. Moderate poverty is particularly concentrated in low- and middle-income countries, although pockets of it persist even in more developed regions.

This report draws on UNICEF data to provide a comprehensive analysis of moderate poverty across countries and over time. Using Python and the Plotnine visualization library, we examine where poverty is most prevalent, how it changes over time, and how it correlates with key economic indicators like GDP per capita. Our goal is to highlight global patterns, regional disparities, and areas where progress is urgently needed to ensure more equitable development.

## Data Preparation

The dataset used in this report originates from UNICEF’s global monitoring efforts and contains annual records of moderate poverty rates for a wide range of countries. Moderate poverty is defined as living on less than $3.20 per day, adjusted for purchasing power parity. The dataset spans multiple years, allowing for both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. Additional indicators such as GDP per capita were included to explore the economic context of poverty. The data was cleaned and standardized to ensure consistency across countries and time periods, including renaming key columns and removing rows with missing values for analysis.

```{python}
import polars as pl

pl_df = pl.read_csv(
    "merged_unicef_data.csv",
    schema_overrides={
        "Population, total": pl.Float64,
        "GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)": pl.Float64,
        "GNI (current US$)": pl.Float64,
        "Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)": pl.Float64,
        "Life expectancy at birth, total (years)": pl.Float64,
        "Military expenditure (% of GDP)": pl.Float64,
        "Fossil fuel energy consumption (% of total)": pl.Float64,
        "GDP growth (annual %)": pl.Float64,
        "Birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people)": pl.Float64,
        "Hospital beds (per 1,000 people)": pl.Float64,
    }
)

# Rename columns for consistency
pl_df = pl_df.rename({
    "country": "country",
    "obs_value": "obs_value",
    "year": "year",
    "GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)": "GDP"
})

# Convert to Pandas for Plotnine/GeoPandas
df = pl_df.to_pandas()

```

## Top 10 Countries by Average Poverty

This section highlights the countries with the highest average moderate poverty rates over the available time span. By computing the mean poverty rate for each country across all years, we identify persistent poverty hotspots. Unsurprisingly, the top 10 countries are predominantly located in sub-Saharan Africa—a region that continues to struggle with structural poverty due to limited access to education, infrastructure, and stable employment. This ranking sets the stage for understanding where the challenge of poverty is most entrenched.

```{python}
import polars as pl
import geopandas as gpd
from plotnine import *

# Load world shapefile and region info
world = gpd.read_file("ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp")[["NAME", "CONTINENT"]]
world = world.rename(columns={"NAME": "country"})

# Merge with your df
df = df.merge(world, on="country", how="left").rename(columns={"CONTINENT": "region"})

# Compute top 10 countries
top10 = (
    df.groupby(["country", "region"], as_index=False)["obs_value"]
      .mean()
      .nlargest(10, "obs_value")
)
top10["label"] = top10["obs_value"].round(1).astype(str)

# Build plot
(
    ggplot(top10, aes(x='reorder(country, obs_value)', y='obs_value', fill='region')) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity') +
    geom_text(aes(label='label'), nudge_y=1.5, size=6, ha='left', color='black') +
    coord_flip() +
    scale_fill_brewer(type='seq', palette='Blues', name='Region') +
    labs(title='Top 10 Countries by Average Moderate Poverty Rate',

    theme_minimal()
)
```

## Average Moderate Poverty by Country

The map below presents a global snapshot of average moderate poverty rates by country. Countries are color-coded according to their poverty burden, with darker shades indicating higher rates. The geographic disparities are immediately visible: most of Africa, parts of South Asia, and some areas of Latin America exhibit persistently high poverty levels. In contrast, Europe and North America show considerably lower averages. This visual helps reinforce the idea that poverty is not evenly distributed, but rather deeply tied to geography, development status, and historical inequities.

## Scatterplot – Poverty vs GDP 

This scatterplot investigates the relationship between economic development and moderate poverty. Each point represents a single country in a specific year, with GDP per capita on a logarithmic scale. A clear negative relationship emerges: countries with higher income levels tend to experience lower poverty rates. This supports the well-established notion that economic growth plays a crucial role in reducing poverty, but also raises questions about inclusivity, as some nations with growing GDP still report high poverty levels. The regression line offers a helpful estimate of this overall trend.

```{python}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6

import polars as pl
import pandas as pd
from plotnine import (
    ggplot, aes, geom_point, geom_smooth, scale_x_log10,
    labs, theme_minimal
)

# --- Filter and clean using Polars ---
scatter_df = (
    pl_df
    .filter(
        (pl.col("obs_value").is_not_null()) &
        (pl.col("GDP").is_not_null()) &
        (pl.col("GDP") > 500) &
        (pl.col("GDP") < 20000)
    )
    .select(["GDP", "obs_value"])  # only columns needed for plotting
    .to_pandas()
)

# --- Plot ---
(
    ggplot(scatter_df, aes(x='GDP', y='obs_value')) +
    geom_point(alpha=0.6) +
    geom_smooth(method='lm', color='blue') +
    scale_x_log10() +
    labs(
        title='Moderate Poverty vs GDP per Capita',
        x='GDP per Capita (USD, log scale)',
        y='Poverty Rate (%)'
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
)
```

## Time-Series – Average Poverty by Continent

Here, we analyze how moderate poverty has evolved over time at the continental level. By grouping countries by continent and averaging their annual poverty rates, we reveal broader regional trends. Africa shows the highest and most persistent levels of poverty, with only slight declines in recent years. Asia, on the other hand, demonstrates steady improvement, particularly in countries like India and Vietnam. The Americas and Europe maintain relatively lower levels, reflecting stronger social infrastructure and economic stability. These patterns highlight how economic development, governance, and investment priorities influence poverty reduction over time.

## Conclusion

This report provides a multi-dimensional analysis of moderate poverty across the globe, using UNICEF data to explore geographic patterns, economic correlations, and temporal trends. The findings reveal that poverty is not only persistent in specific regions—particularly sub-Saharan Africa—but also closely tied to broader socioeconomic conditions like GDP per capita. While global poverty has generally declined over the past two decades, progress has been uneven, and many countries continue to face deep structural challenges. Reducing moderate poverty further will require not just economic growth, but also inclusive development strategies, social safety nets, and long-term policy commitment at both national and international levels. The insights in this report can support data-driven decision-making aimed at achieving more equitable outcomes for vulnerable populations.
